Hi there, I am Francesco, welcome to my website.

<br>
I am currently working at TU Delft, where I am developing an equation-oriented preliminary code for design and analysis of turbomachinery. My goal is to offer a single design platform for turbines and compressors of any meridional topology, with specific focus on gradient-based design optimization.
<br>
<br>

I previously attended POLIMI, where I graduated with a master thesis on the aerodynamic and mechanical design of an unsteady supersonic cascade wind tunnel. We set out to study the effect of high frequency inlet flow oscillations on fully supersonic cascades, with the goal of applying such knowledge to turbine design for rotating detonation engines. The tunnel is under construction at the Laboratory of Fluid Machinery.

At the end of 2021 I took a break from my studies to carry out an internship at *Scuderia AlphaTauri*, in the CFD methodology group. During my time there I worked on automated workflows and computational techniques, specifically with <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/">OpenFOAM</a> and <a href="https://engys.com/helyx/">HELYX</a>, applied to external aerodynamic design.
